    <p>I'm <b>Jericho</b>. About me? I still dont have an <em>achievements</em> that can be proud of. <br>
         But I have a goal, to be a Senior Software Engineer. Maybe it is quite imposible, but there's nothing to lose. <br> Don't let others dictate your life. Regrets comes from listening to others on what they want you to become. Keep <u>practicing</u>. <sub>Every</sub> steps <sup>has</sup> its value</p>
